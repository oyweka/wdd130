            Hello, my name is Alex Ochieng Oyweka. I am a Kenyan living in Nairobi City.
            I am a last-born in a family of four children. I have one brother and two sisters. Our first born is a girl,
            and is now married.
            The second born is my brother and the third is my sister. They are all married.
            I was born in a christian family though not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint. My
            parents church, which I attended for most of my life is the Pentecostal Assemblies of God.
            I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint, through my younger sister who is married to a
            bishop of our ward.
            I lived in Nairobi until I completed my primary school.
            For secondary school, I studied in a rural town in Kakemega county.
            After this, I moved to Eldoret where I did my Bachelor's degree and graduated in 2015. I became interest in
            tech, and decided to join BYU-Pathway and pursue a degree in software development.
            I am excited to join this class and learn web development. I am sure I will enjoy the class.
            Outside classroom, I love football, where I play as a midfielder.
